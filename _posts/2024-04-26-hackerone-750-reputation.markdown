Some time back, I  received an email from HackerOne congratulating me on reaching 750 reputation points on HackerOne. At the time, I was filled with so much joy since the 750 reputation mark is one of my "checkpoint goals" in doing bug bounty mainly just because I really really wanted to have a HackerOne tshirt!

I received my package after about a month and a half due to some shipping issues within the country. It included a HackerOne tshirt (ofcourse), and a HackerOne laptop camera cover.

I was also very happy that the T-shirt is neither too tight nor too loose; it just fits very nicely! The tshirt is also not too thick that it is hot and heavy to wear outside.

Again for me, this HackerOne swag represents not only tangible rewards but also intangible values such as a little bit of recognition from the community, and more motivation to continue reporting vulnerabilities and issues.

Next Goal: 1500 Reputation - HackerOne Cap !!
