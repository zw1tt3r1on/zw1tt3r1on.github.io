Last January 2024, I have received an email from HackerOne congratulating me on reaching 500 reputation points on HackerOne. Upon reading this email, I was filled with joy as for the first time, I have felt that my contributions to the field of cybersecurity was recognized even just for a little bit. 

As some of you may know, I only hunt and look for issues on Vulnerability Disclosure Programs (VDPs). Hence, I do not get paid for any of the issues that I submit to HackerOne.

Fast forward to about a month, I have finally received my HackerOne 500 reputation swag package that contained a pair of socks and an organic tote bag.

To me, these swags are not just a pair of socks and an organic tote bag. They symbolize a small for me and my career and acknowledge the countless hours that I have dedicated to honing my skills in different fields of cybersecurity.
