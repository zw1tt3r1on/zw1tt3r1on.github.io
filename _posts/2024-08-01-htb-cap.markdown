Seeing that there is ftp open, we try to login anonymously but seems like anonymous login is not enabled

Investigating on the web application, we see that there seems to be some security snapshots that are being stored and downloaded

Seeing that it uses incremental data, maybe we can visit /data/0, which we do and we can download the pcap file

Opening this pcap file, we see the traffic being sent to the server and since FTP traffic is unencrypted, we can see nathan's credentials here

So with this, we can just login to the ftp server as nathan and get the user flag

Or we can also just ssh to the machine using nathan's credentials and get the user flag

Looking for privilege escalation paths, we try and see the installed packages on the machine and we see that there is a vulnerable version of polkit

With this, we just download pwnkit on the machine and run it to get root and the root flag
