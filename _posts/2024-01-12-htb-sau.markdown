# Recon

Let us start with our nmap scan

---
Starting Nmap 7.94 ( https://nmap.org ) at 2024-01-12 00:26 EST
Nmap scan report for 10.10.11.224
Host is up (0.058s latency).
Not shown: 997 closed tcp ports (reset)
PORT      STATE    SERVICE
22/tcp    open     ssh
80/tcp    filtered http
55555/tcp open     unknown

Nmap done: 1 IP address (1 host up) scanned in 13.82 seconds

We can see that we have port 22, 80 and 55555, but port 80 is filtered so we cannot visit this even if we try, so we first try visiting port 55555.

We see that this is Request Baskets and upon searching about this, we find that there is an SSRF issue here that we can leverage.
We can forward port 80 to this request baskets.
