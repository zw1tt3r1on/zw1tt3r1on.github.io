In the world of cybersecurity, HackerOne stands as one of the most well known bug bounty platforms out there. For bug bounty hunters, it is widely known that the submission of even a single report to a public bug bounty program is already a significant achievement. This recognition stems from the fact that the majority, if not all, of these targets were initially deployed within a private program, giving the select bug bounty hunters and testers the opportunity to rigorously test the aoplications and report on the discovered bugs. Hence, when these targets are released to a public program, the targets already have undergone extensive testing and hardening.

I will not make this blog post long as I just want to extend my gratitude to my friends who have been instrumental in shaping my journey over the past year.

Cheers to more learnings and more reported bugs in 2024!
